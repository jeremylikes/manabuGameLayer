# What this is
This is a smattering of gameplay layer code for my indie video game "Manabu".  Manabu is an action role plyaing game which asks the player 
to produce Japanese kanji when they want to cast spells.  If the player wants to case a fire spell, for example, they are required to write 
the Japanese kanji for fire (火) on the screen in order to generate the spell.
